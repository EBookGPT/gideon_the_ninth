## Gideon the Ninth: Outline

**Chapter 1: The Ninth House**

**Setting:** The Ninth House, a crumbling gothic manor perched precariously on a windswept Scottish cliff. It's a decaying relic of a once-grand dynasty, its halls filled with the echoes of forgotten necromancers and the whispers of ancient secrets. The air hangs heavy with the scent of decay and the chilling presence of death.  

**Characters:**

* **Gideon Nav:** A jaded, sarcastic sword-wielder, she's been the Ninth House's "necromancer" for years, but her skills are more about dodging responsibility than actual necromancy. Her cynicism is a shield against a deep-seated vulnerability, a fear of the world she can't understand. She's fiercely independent and loyal to those she considers her own. 
* **Harrowhark Nonagesimus:** A brilliant, ambitious, and ruthless necromancer, Harrowhark arrives at the Ninth House with the Emperor's mandate to take over. She's a walking paradox, her calculating ambition masking a deep-seated insecurity and fear of failure. Her goal is to gain power, not for herself, but to protect those she cares about, even if it means becoming a monster in the process.
* **The Locked Tomb:** A vast, ancient tomb beneath the Ninth House, its entrance sealed by centuries of neglect.  Legends whisper of its secrets, of unimaginable power, but also of the terrible price one must pay to unlock its secrets.
