## A Critique of "Gideon the Ninth":  A Tomb of Missed Opportunities

This critique is meant to be brutally honest, with the goal of pushing the author toward "show, don't tell," creative dialogue, and more engaging narrative storytelling.  It's time to exhume this manuscript and breathe some life into it.

**The Problem with "Telling"**:  The writing is drowning in exposition.  We're told about Harrowhark's ambition, Gideon's loyalty, the Emperor's power, the Ninth House's decay - but we never *feel* it.  We're given a list of adjectives (dead, broken, empty, etc.) instead of being immersed in the world.

**Example**:  "The Ninth House was a tomb. It wasn't a mausoleum, though. Not yet. Not quite. But it was a dead thing, a broken thing, a thing that had forgotten how to breathe." 

**Solution**:  Show us the Ninth House.  Describe the crumbling architecture, the silence that hangs heavy, the scent of decay, the way the wind whistles through broken windows.  Instead of saying it's "dead," show us a scene where a crow picks at a decaying skull in the courtyard.

**The Bland Dialogue**:  The conversations feel stiff and formal, lacking the spark of personality or conflict.  Even the supposed tension between Harrowhark and Gideon feels more like a polite disagreement.  

**Example**: "What's your name?" Harrowhark asked, her voice cool.

"Gideon. Gideon Nav," the woman said, her voice flat and lifeless.

**Solution**:  Infuse the dialogue with subtext.  Harrowhark could be sizing up Gideon, her voice laced with suspicion, "So, you're the 'caretaker.'  Interesting." Gideon could respond with a sardonic smile, "Yes, and you're the Emperor's favorite.  It's all so terribly fascinating."  Make them clash, even subtly, with their word choices and tone. 

**The Missing Narrative**:  The story feels like a series of events strung together with minimal connective tissue.  Where's the conflict?  The emotional stakes?  We're told about Harrowhark's ambition, but we don't see her wrestling with it, making choices that define her character.

**Solution**:  Embed the story within a narrative arc.  What is Harrowhark's ultimate goal?  What obstacles stand in her way?  What internal conflicts does she face?  Show us the consequences of her ambition, the choices she makes, the sacrifices she's willing to take. 

**The Need for Conflict**:  The "tension" between Harrowhark and Gideon feels superficial, more like two strong personalities bumping heads than a true clash of wills.  

**Solution**:  Create a conflict that forces them to rely on each other.  Maybe they're trapped in a deadly situation, forced to cooperate to survive.  Maybe Harrowhark's ambition endangers Gideon's life, creating a chasm of mistrust. 

**Finally, the Emperor's Touch**: The Emperor's presence feels like a vague threat, a looming figure in the shadows.  Make him a more tangible presence.  Show his influence on the characters, his machinations, his methods.  

**Solution**:  Give him a voice, even if it's through a messenger, a dream, or a whispered word.  Show how his power shapes the world, the choices of the characters, even the very air they breathe.

**In Conclusion**:  This manuscript has the potential for something truly compelling.  But it needs a thorough overhaul.  Focus on "showing" instead of "telling," craft dynamic dialogue, and weave a narrative that compels the reader to turn the page, desperate to see what happens next.  The Locked Tomb is waiting to be unearthed; it's time to give it the life it deserves.
