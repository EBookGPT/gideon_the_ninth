## Chapter 1: The Ninth House

The Ninth House was a tomb. It wasn't a mausoleum, though. Not yet. Not quite. But it was a dead thing, a broken thing, a thing that had forgotten how to breathe. It was a monument to a past that had no one to remember it, and it lay slumped against the cliffs of the Scottish coast like a drunkard asleep in a ditch.

It looked, in truth, like a thing built by a child who had been given a box of Legos and a set of instructions in an ancient, forgotten tongue. No human would have built such a thing, not without the compulsion of madness or the mandate of an Emperor.

But even with the Emperor's Mandate, Harrowhark Nonagesimus had not been prepared for the sheer decrepitude of the Ninth House. She had expected something... less. Less *decay*. Less *emptiness*. Less *silence*. 

It was, she'd decided after a week spent wandering the shadowed halls, an excellent place to be alone. Which was, after all, what she'd been doing for the better part of the last five years. 

She had spent those years buried in the Emperor's archives, trying to read and understand and, most importantly, master necromancy. There had been nothing to distract her, nothing but the Emperor's ceaseless, insatiable hunger for power. And Harrowhark, with her own hunger for power, had been happy to serve. 

She was a brilliant necromancer. A prodigious one. Even the Emperor, who was not known for his compliments, had called her "exceptional." But the Emperor's favor was a fickle thing, and Harrowhark knew it. She had seen him discard his favorites as easily as he cast off his old clothes.

So Harrowhark had always strived for more, always pushed herself further. She craved something beyond the Emperor's favor. Something *real*. 

And when the Emperor had called upon her to take charge of the Ninth House, she had seen it as her opportunity. Not merely to prove her worth, but to build a legacy. To create something beyond the Emperor's reach, something that would bear her name forever.

But the Ninth House was a graveyard, and Harrowhark found herself faced with the overwhelming reality of the dead. There was no one to greet her, no one to teach her the ways of the Ninth House. Just the ghosts of the past and the silence of the present.

The Ninth House was a terrible thing. It was a broken thing. But Harrowhark, in her endless ambition, saw it as a blank slate. It was a space for her to build, to grow, to reshape. She would make it her own. She would leave her mark on it.

And she would not be alone.

She turned from the crumbling facade of the Ninth House and faced the cliffs. The wind whipped around her, carrying the scent of salt and decay. Below, the sea churned, a vast, dark canvas painted with the swirling patterns of an angry storm. The sky was a bruised purple, and the clouds were thick with the promise of rain. 

"It's a beautiful day for a funeral," a voice rasped.

Harrowhark turned to see Gideon Nav standing beneath the eaves of the porch, her sword propped against the wall beside her. She was a tall woman, clad in a tattered leather jerkin and pants. Her hair was a tangled mess of black, her face streaked with grime. She looked like she had just stepped out of a tomb, and Harrowhark had a sudden urge to check her pulse.

Gideon's eyes were sharp and alert, her gaze flitting over Harrowhark from head to toe. She seemed to be taking in every detail, from the fine silk of Harrowhark's dress to the glint of the necromancer's sigil on her wrist.

"Is that supposed to be a joke?" Harrowhark asked.

"It's a rhetorical question," Gideon said.

Harrowhark felt a flicker of irritation. She didn't like this woman. She wasn't sure why. Gideon seemed to be nothing more than a simple sword-wielder, a relic from a bygone age. Yet Harrowhark felt a prickle of unease, a sense of foreboding.

"What's your name?" Harrowhark asked, her voice cool.

"Gideon. Gideon Nav," the woman said, her voice flat and lifeless. "And you're Harrowhark Nonagesimus, the new necromancer. The Emperor's favorite."

Harrowhark frowned. "I wouldn't call myself the Emperor's favorite. He has many favorites."

"But he's sent you here," Gideon said, her voice a low growl. "He's given you this tomb."

Harrowhark felt a sudden, sharp chill. It was the kind of chill that came from the proximity of a necromancer, a shiver that sent a tremor down her spine. She hadn't expected Gideon to be a necromancer. 

"Why are you here?" Harrowhark asked, her voice wary.

"I've been the Ninth House's...  *caretaker*... for a while now," Gideon said, her gaze fixed on the storm clouds.  "And I'm going to be perfectly honest, I am not thrilled to be relieved of my duties."

Harrowhark felt her temper rising. "This is the Emperor's Mandate. You have no say in the matter."

"Oh, I think I do," Gideon said, turning to face Harrowhark, her eyes glittering with a strange light. "I am, after all, the Ninth House's *sword*. And I don't take kindly to people coming into my house and telling me what to do."

Harrowhark's hand went to the sigil on her wrist, the symbol of the Emperor's power. She knew she had nothing to fear from a simple sword-wielder. But Gideon Nav had a way of looking at her, a way of speaking that made Harrowhark feel… *vulnerable*.

Harrowhark took a step forward, her chin raised. "This is not your house," she said, her voice firm. "It is the Ninth House. And I am its new necromancer."

Gideon Nav simply smiled, a slow, dangerous smile.  Her eyes, dark and unreadable, held a glint of steel. "We'll see about that," she said.

Harrowhark felt a tremor of fear. This woman, this sword-wielder, was more than she seemed. And the Ninth House, this dead thing, this tomb, was full of secrets. 


## Chapter 2: The Emperor's Favor

The Emperor's Palace was a thing of obsidian and bone, a vast monument to a power both terrifying and alluring. It was a city unto itself, its walls studded with the bleached skulls of past necromancers, their empty sockets staring out into the world with a chilling emptiness. 

Harrowhark Nonagesimus, her black dress a stark contrast against the skeletal architecture, felt a flicker of unease as she stepped onto the polished marble floor of the main courtyard. The air was thick with the scent of sulfur and decay, a constant reminder of the nature of the Emperor's power.

Gideon Nav, her face a mask of indifference, walked beside her. She had chosen to wear her usual garb, a worn leather jerkin and pants, her sword strapped to her back. She looked out of place, a jarring note in the symphony of obsidian and bone. 

But Gideon Nav was not one to be concerned with appearances. She was a woman who lived by her own rules, and she cared little for the trappings of power.

Harrowhark, on the other hand, was acutely aware of the Emperor's gaze. It was a chilling presence, a weight that pressed down on her like a shroud. She felt it everywhere, in the whispered conversations, in the furtive glances, in the subtle shifts of power.

The Emperor was a creature of shadows, a being of immense power, whose true face no one had ever seen. He ruled with a chilling indifference, dispensing favors and punishments with equal measure.

His servants, the Lyctors, were his chosen instruments, each a powerful necromancer in their own right. They navigated the treacherous court with a mix of charm, manipulation, and ruthless ambition.

As Harrowhark and Gideon stepped into the palace, a figure emerged from the shadows. He was tall and slender, his face framed by a cascade of dark hair. His eyes, a deep, unsettling blue, held a glint of amusement.

"Ah, Harrowhark Nonagesimus," he said, his voice smooth and honeyed. "Welcome to the Emperor's court. You must be exhausted from your long journey. I'm Ortus Nigenad, one of the Emperor's Lyctors. Let me show you to your chambers."

Harrowhark felt a flicker of suspicion. Ortus Nigenad's smile was too wide, his eyes too keen. He seemed to be assessing her, gauging her strength and weaknesses. 

"Thank you," Harrowhark said, her voice cool.

"Gideon Nav," Ortus said, turning to Harrowhark's companion. "It's a pleasure to meet you."

Gideon Nav barely acknowledged him, her gaze fixed on the intricate carvings on the wall.

"You're Harrowhark's…  *aide*?" Ortus asked, his voice laced with amusement.

"I'm her sword," Gideon said, her voice flat.

Ortus chuckled, a low, throaty sound. "A sword, are you?  Interesting.  Perhaps you'll be of use."

Harrowhark felt her temper rising. "I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself, Lyctor," she said, her voice sharp.

Ortus simply smiled. "Of course, Harrowhark. You are the Emperor's favorite, after all."

He led them through the palace, past countless halls and chambers, each adorned with the chilling trophies of the Emperor's power. Harrowhark tried to ignore Ortus's probing gaze, his constant stream of veiled comments. She had come to the Emperor's court to secure his favor, not to become entangled in the games of its Lyctors.

But Ortus Nigenad was not easily ignored. He was a master of manipulation, a weaver of webs of intrigue.  He had a way of making Harrowhark feel like a pawn in his game, a puppet dancing on his strings.

Finally, they reached Harrowhark's chambers. It was a luxurious suite, its walls lined with bookshelves filled with ancient texts on necromancy. But Harrowhark felt no sense of comfort. The room was too grand, too opulent. It felt like a cage, a gilded trap.

"I'll leave you to settle in," Ortus said, his gaze lingering on Harrowhark. "We'll meet again soon.  I have much to teach you."

Harrowhark watched him go, a flicker of unease in her heart. She knew that Ortus Nigenad was not to be trusted. He was a player in the Emperor's game, and he was not above using her to advance his own ambitions.

"So, we're going to be roommates?" Gideon said, her voice tinged with sarcasm.

Harrowhark turned to her, her expression unreadable. "I am the necromancer of the Ninth House," she said. "You are its… *sword*.  It is your duty to serve me."

"And what if I don't want to?" Gideon said, her eyes glinting with defiance.

Harrowhark felt a surge of anger. "You have no choice," she said.

"That's what they always say," Gideon said, a ghost of a smile playing on her lips. "But then they never count on the sword deciding to break free."

Harrowhark turned away, her gaze fixed on the intricate carvings on the wall. She had a sudden, disturbing premonition that this was not going to be an easy task.

The Emperor's favor was a fickle thing. And Gideon Nav, with her dangerous edge and her unwavering loyalty to her own self, was a wild card that could easily disrupt Harrowhark's plans.

The Emperor's court was a dangerous place. A place where ambition was a weapon, and loyalty was a mask.  Harrowhark knew she had to tread carefully, her every move calculated, her every word measured.  But she also knew that she would need more than cunning and ambition to survive in this world of shadows.

She would need Gideon Nav.

And she was not sure she wanted to know what price she would have to pay for her loyalty.



## Chapter 3: The Ninth House's Legacy 

The Ninth House was no longer a tomb, but it was not yet a home. It was a battleground, a chaotic swirl of magic and ambition, where the lines between life and death blurred and the shadows held secrets both ancient and terrible. 

Harrowhark Nonagesimus, her ambition twisting within her like a serpent, had not secured the Emperor's favor. Instead, she found herself caught in a web of intrigue, a pawn in the Emperor's game. His whispers, carried on the wind and etched into the walls of the Ninth House, had twisted her plans, warped her desires, and turned her into something she barely recognized. 

Gideon Nav, her loyalty tested and stretched, watched Harrowhark with a mix of concern and disdain.  She had never understood ambition, never craved power.  Her world was simple: loyalty to those she cared for, and a relentless pursuit of a life free of obligation. But Harrowhark's ambition, her relentless pursuit of a legacy, was a force that threatened to consume them both. 

The Ninth House, once a silent monument to a forgotten dynasty, pulsed with an energy that felt both ancient and alien. The walls themselves seemed to whisper, echoing the Emperor's will and the secrets of the Locked Tomb, a vast, subterranean labyrinth that held the key to power beyond even the Emperor's reach.  

The air hung heavy with the scent of sulfur and decay, a reminder of the dark magic that coursed through the Ninth House. It was a magic that corrupted, that warped, that whispered promises of immortality while leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. 

Gideon felt it, the insidious pull of the dark magic, its tendrils reaching for her, tempting her with the promise of power and freedom. But she resisted, her loyalty to Harrowhark, her own stubborn independence, pulling her back from the precipice. 

Harrowhark, however, was not so resistant.  She had surrendered to the Emperor's will, her ambition twisting into something monstrous, a hunger for power that consumed all else.  The line between her ambition and her humanity was blurring, her decisions driven by a need to prove her worth, to secure her place among the Emperor's chosen.

Gideon, forced to watch this metamorphosis, felt a cold dread creeping into her heart.  She had always known Harrowhark to be ambitious, but she had never imagined the depths of her obsession, the price she was willing to pay.

The Emperor's Lyctors, their true motives revealed, swarmed around the Ninth House, their whispers and machinations a constant threat. Ortus Nigenad, his charm a mask for a ruthless ambition, had manipulated Harrowhark, twisting her plans to his own advantage. Ianthe Trivess, a seductive temptress with a heart of ice, had poisoned Harrowhark's mind, fueling her ambitions with whispers of power and glory. 

The Emperor, his true nature laid bare, was a force far more sinister than any necromancer had imagined. He was not a ruler, but a puppet master, manipulating his servants, his chosen, with a chilling indifference.  He wanted to break Harrowhark, to mold her into a weapon, to use her to secure his own immortality. 

The secrets of the Locked Tomb were slowly revealed, but not without a terrible price. Harrowhark, driven by ambition and the Emperor's will, delved deeper into its depths, uncovering knowledge that twisted her soul and forced her to make choices that would forever change her. 

Gideon, caught in the maelstrom of Harrowhark's ambition and the Emperor's machinations, was faced with a choice:  remain loyal to a woman who was becoming a monster, or break free from the Emperor's control and face the consequences.

The Ninth House, once a tomb, was now a crucible, a place where destinies were forged and souls were tested. Harrowhark and Gideon, bound by a fragile thread of loyalty, were caught in the crossfire, forced to confront the darkness within themselves and the terrifying truth of the Emperor's power.

Their choices would decide not only their fates, but the legacy of the Ninth House, a legacy that would forever be marked by the Emperor's touch and the price of ambition.
